This repo contains the files required for my checkbook application project in Python. This project required me to read and write from a text file that would keep a record of the app user's balance even after closing the command line app. My goals were to make the app unbreakable and comfortable to read for the user with timed print statements. This is the first application I have ever made, and I learned some valuable lessons during the process. I can improve this project by creating a module of functions to streamline the python file that runs the app. Specifically, I would like to create a read function and a write function. I would also like to try a version of this app that creates a history of transactions that is accessible to the user.
